# Haskell Exercises

This repo contains various exercises and material that I've worked through while learning Haskell.

## CIS 194 - Introduction to Haskell

The UPenn course [CIS 194 - Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) has an excellent reputation for learning functional programming using Haskell.

My solutions to the homework can be found in [cis-194-2013](./cis-194-2013).

## Real World Haskell

Coming soon...
